"You... don't have to be... the bad guy. You are the most talented... the most interesting... and the most extraordinary person in the universe. And you are capable of amazing things, because YOU are The Special. And so am I, and so is everyone. The prophecy is made up, but it's also true. It's about all of us, right now, it's about you, and you, still, can change everything."
